Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering This project applies the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history, specifically focusing on Annual Income and Spending Score. The objective is to analyze customer behavior and identify distinct customer segments, which can help businesses optimize marketing strategies, tailor customer experiences, and improve overall engagement.

Features Implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm. Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature scaling. Determination of the optimal number of clusters using: Elbow Method Silhouette Analysis Visualization of customer segments using intuitive scatter plots. Insights into customer behavior based on clusters. Technologies Used Programming Language: Python Libraries: Pandas (Data manipulation) NumPy (Numerical computations) Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data visualization) Scikit-learn (Clustering and metrics) Dataset Dataset Source: Kaggle - Customer Segmentation Tutorial Key Features Used: Annual Income (Customer's income in k$) Spending Score (Customer's spending behavior, scored from 1 to 100) Project Outcomes Identified distinct groups of customers based on their spending and income patterns. Provided actionable insights to enhance customer targeting and personalization.
